## Introduction

The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers that produces a particular type of fractal when plotted. The Julia set is closely related and is derived from the Mandelbrot set by fixing a complex number and varying the initial value.

## Requirements

To run the scripts for plotting the Mandelbrot and Julia sets, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
